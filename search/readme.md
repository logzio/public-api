# Search API

## General
The Search API allows Logz.io users to run queries on the data in their account via REST (i.e. HTTP). The query language used is Elasticsearch Search API DSL, with certain limitations. We highly recommend you read the restrictions listed below (In the Request Body section) before beginning to use the API

## License 
Using the API requires a special license from Logz.io, and an API token which can be generated here: https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/shared-tokens 

The number of queries executed is controlled and limited by Logz.io.

Your query will only run on data you sent today and yesterday.

The number of results are limited to 10,000.


## Search Command

### URL
URL: https://api.logz.io/v1/search (US Accounts)
     https://api-eu.logz.io/v1/search (EU Accounts)
* Make sure to use https and not http, otherwise you will get a '403 Forbidden' response..

### HTTP Headers
* "X-USER-TOKEN" -  The value should be the API token you generated (as explained in the License section above)
* "Content-Type" - "application/json"  (required)

### Request Body 
Elasticsearch Search API Body as documented  in [Elaticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.x/search.html), with the following restrictions:
* We support the following top-level elements in the Elasticsearch Search API:  `query`, `from`, `size`, `sort`, `_source`, `post_filter`, `aggs`, `aggregations`
* When using the `query_string` element, you are not allowed to set its field named `allow_leading_wildcard` to true
* When using the `wildcard` element, you are not allowed to have its value start with `*` or `?`
* Your query will only run on data you sent today and yesterday. You can still specify a filter on the timestamp field to allow smaller time frame.
* When specifying the `size` element for aggregations, the value cannot exceed 1000.
* You can not nest 2 or more bucket aggregations of the following types: `date_histogram`, `geohash_grid`, `histogram`, `ip_ranges`, `significant_terms` and `terms`
* You can not sort on the `message` field
* You can not aggregate on the `message` field
* You can not use the aggregation type `significant_terms`
* You can not use the `fuzzy_max_expansions` or `max_expansions` elements inside the `query` element
* You can not use the `max_determinized_states` element inside the `query` element

## Example

Create a file named `query.json` and place the following query in it:
```json
{
	"size": 0,
	"query": {
		"bool": {
			"must": [{
				"range": {
					"@timestamp": {
						"gte": "now-5m",
						"lte": "now"
					}
				}
			}]
		}
	},
	"aggs": {
		"byType": {
			"terms": {
				"field": "type",
				"size": 5
			}
		}
	}
}
```
This query returns the count of documents per each value of the field `type`, in the last 5 minutes

Run the following command:
```bash
curl -XPOST 'https://api.logz.io/v1/search'  --header "X-USER-TOKEN: your-api-access-token" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @query.json
```

Make sure to replace `your-api-access-token` with the token you created as instructed in License section

Example result:

```json
{
  "hits": {
    "total": 339604,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "byType": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 44879,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "web-app",
          "doc_count": 163690
        },
        {
          "key": "core-service",
          "doc_count": 64893
        }      
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
